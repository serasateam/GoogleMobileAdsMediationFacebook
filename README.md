# FBAudienceNetwork iOS SDK
FBAudienceNetwork iOS SDK for Swift Package Manager.

# Integration
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.
To integrate the FBAudienceNetwork SDK into your project using Swift Package Manager:
1. Add it to the dependencies of your Package.swift:
```objc
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/serasateam/GoogleMobileAdsMediationFacebook", .exact("6.9.0"))
    ]
```
2. Enable the `-ObjC` flag in Xcode: select Build Settings, search for Other Linker Flags and add `-ObjC`.
